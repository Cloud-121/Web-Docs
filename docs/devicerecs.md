## Solar Node Recommendations

### Pre-made Solar Nodes
If you prefer a "plug-and-play" solution that is weather-ready out of the box, the **SenseCAP P1** or **P1 Pro** from [Seeed Studio](https://www.seeedstudio.com/SenseCAP-Solar-Node-P1-for-Meshtastic-LoRa-p-6425.html?sensecap_affiliate=Je7dGgm&referring_service=link) are excellent choices. These units integrate the solar controller and enclosure, saving you significant assembly time. you can recieve a 5% discount by code S9ZRMA1X at checkout.

The **P1** is $35 cheaper as it does not include batteries or GPS; you will need to supply four 18650 batteries yourself. By comparison, the **P1 Pro** includes everything you need to get started, including an integrated GPS module.

### Repeater Nodes to Build
For those DIYing their own repeater or solar enclosures, here are some boards we recommend.

#### Top Picks:
* **Heltec V4:** Our recommended board for repeater deployments using Meshcore
* **Heltec T114**: A more power efficient alternative, but with less output power. Perfect for Meshtastic.

The Rak WisMesh board's are shown to have horrible QC, inconsistent performance, and have been shown to fail in the field. They've now been removed from our recommendations and we'll stop recommending them in the future unless they improve.
